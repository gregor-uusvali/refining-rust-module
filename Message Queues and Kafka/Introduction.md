# Introduction

When creating an application, sometimes the application needs to read in events from other applications. For example, if an application is reading in from a news feed, it needs to listen to the news application to get events from the feed.

This can be a tricky problem to solve as applications may not want to maintain an API that updates so frequently. Getting data from an API can also be a large use of resources as the database needs to be maintained and the application will need to handle high traffic.

An alternative way for multiple services to communicate is by using message queues.

### Topics, Producers and Consumers


## Why do we need them?
