**Introduction**

  

Before Rust became an optional branch, I was excited about learning the language alongside other students. However, now that it's not required, I'm hesitant to choose it due to the large number of group projects. Some tasks even demand at least 4 or 6 people. I have spoken with many other students, and so far, I haven't found many who would opt for this branch. The language is challenging to learn, and there aren't many job opportunities in the current job market in Estonia for Rust. Additionally, the branch itself presents a steep difficulty curve, transitioning from JavaScript, where you create simple 2D games, to developing an actual FPS game.

  

Currently, I believe Go is an excellent language to start with, and it's crucial to learn JavaScript because of its popularity. Therefore, I would keep those languages as mandatory branches with some refinements. However, given the discussions around adding new branches such as Java and PHP, I propose the inclusion of a shorter branch with tasks that can be done in any language. This way, students can choose the language they want to learn for this branch. Another approach could be to make some tasks optional, similar to the existing ones that focus on C.

  

Rust, as a language, holds a lot of potential for the future. However, the current learning branch is too difficult for those transitioning from JavaScript, resulting in many people not choosing it. By introducing a smaller mandatory branch where students can learn a language of their choice, it would allow students to experiment with other tools they could use. 

  

**Issues**

  

*   Rust branch has a steep learning curve
*   Alot of group tasks
*   Small benefit in the job market
*   Since not mandatory smaller group of students to collaborate

**Solution**

  

*   Creating a new smaller mandatory branch where students choose the language they want to learn and would be able to do solo. (sth similar to Advent of Code)

  

**Plan for the Day**

**Team Roles**



*   Team lead - manages the team and communication between members
*   Developer - helps come up with some tasks that could be implemented in any programming language.
*   Documentation writer - writes understandable description for the tasks
*   Designer - helps make the tasks design more interesting

**Wish List of Skills**

  

*   Developer
*   Documentation writer
*   Designer

  

**Timeline**

  

**10:00 - 12:00**

Introduction to the goal

Research for material 

Brainstorming tasks and implementations of the new branch

**13:00 - 15:00**

Design and development of new tasks 

Documentation writing

Refinement

**15:00 - 15:30**

Final presentation forming

**Action Items/Things to Research during the Hackathon**

  

*   Advent of Code for reference
*   Writing a sample task 

**Expected Deliverables from the Day**

  

*   Rough outline of a new branch where students choose a language that they want to learn.
*   Some task ideas that are interesting to implement in any programming language .
