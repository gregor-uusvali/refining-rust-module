# refining-rust-module

## Intro

Before Rust became an optional branch, I was excited about learning the language alongside other students. However, now that it's not required, I'm hesitant to choose it due to the large number of group projects. Some tasks even demand at least 4 or 6 people. I have spoken with many other students, and so far, I haven't found many who would opt for this branch. The language is challenging to learn, and there aren't many job opportunities in the current job market in Estonia for Rust. Additionally, the branch itself presents a steep difficulty curve, transitioning from JavaScript, where you create simple 2D games, to developing an actual FPS game.

Currently, I believe Go is an excellent language to start with, and it's crucial to learn JavaScript because of its popularity. Therefore, I would keep those languages as mandatory branches with some refinements. However, given the discussions around adding new branches such as Java and PHP, I propose the inclusion of a shorter branch with tasks that can be done in any language. This way, students can choose the language they want to learn for this branch. Another approach could be to make some tasks optional, similar to the existing ones that focus on C.

Rust, as a language, holds a lot of potential for the future. However, the current learning branch is too difficult for those transitioning from JavaScript, resulting in many people not choosing it. By introducing a smaller mandatory branch where students can learn a language of their choice, it would allow students to experiment with other tools they could use.

### Issues

- The branch has a steep learning curve
- Alot of group tasks
- Small benefit it the job market

### Solutions

- Having a small mandatory branch where you choose the language you want to learn
- Making an optional task that requires the language
- Refining the task to be able to be done solo (removing the FPS project)
