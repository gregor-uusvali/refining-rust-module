## Context
Testing is an important part of application development cycle. Testing allows us to ensure that our software works according to the "specification".

## Task
As part of implementation of the REST api task, we will also be adding test for the application to ensure that our application behaves as intented. 
We will do this by implementing unit and integration tests for the application.

As part of the unit testing, we will write tests that validate the functionality of individual functions/methods.
As part of integration testing, we will write tests the validate the functionality as a whole, for example making sure a REST endpoints returns the correct data or persists information correctly, when we "programmatically" send requests to the endpoint.

### Frameworks
Below are a list of testing frameworks for the java language:
[Junit - A unit testing framework](https://junit.org/junit5/)

[Spring boot test - A integration test framework on top of the spring framework](https://spring.io/guides/gs/testing-web/)

[Mockito - A mocking framework mocking/stubbinb objects](https://site.mockito.org/)

[WireMock - Used to simulate/mock HTTP response](https://wiremock.org/)

[AssertJ - A java language assertion framework](https://assertj.github.io/doc/)

[Hamcrest - A multi language assertion framework](https://hamcrest.org/)
